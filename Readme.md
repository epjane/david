# david - The simple WebDAV server... extended.
A new fork of [dave](https://github.com/micromata/dave)

## Introduction

_david_ is a simple WebDAV server that provides the following features:

- Single binary that runs under Windows, Linux and OSX.
- Authentication via HTTP-Basic.
- CRUD operation permissions
- TLS support - if needed.
- A simple user management which allows user-directory-jails as well as full admin access to
  all subdirectories.
- Live config reload to allow editing of users without downtime.
- A cli tool to generate BCrypt password hashes.

It perfectly fits if you would like to give some people the possibility to upload, download or
share files with common tools like the OSX Finder, Windows Explorer or Nautilus under Linux
([or many other tools](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_WebDAV_software#WebDAV_clients)).

The project david is an extension from the project [dave](https://github.com/micromata/dave)

## Installation

### Build from sources

#### Setup

1. Make sure to have [Golang installed](https://go.dev/doc/install)
2. Clone the repository (or your fork)

```sh
git clone https://github.com/audstanley/david
```

3. Build and install the binaries

```sh
cd cmd/david && go build . && mv ./david ~/go/bin/david
cd ../bcpt && go build . && mv bcpt ~/go/bin/bcpt && cd ../..
```

Alternatively, use mage to build:

```sh
mage Build
```

This will create binaries in the `dist/` directory.

#### Command Line Usage

The `david` CLI now uses Cobra with subcommands for better structure and help:

```sh
# Start the server (default command)
david server --config config.yaml

# Start server with overrides
david server --host 127.0.0.1 --port 9000 --debug

# Get help
david --help
david server --help
david completion --help
```

**Available Commands:**

- `server` - Start the WebDAV server
- `help` - Help about any command
- `completion` - Generate autocompletion script

**Server Flags:**

- `-c, --config string` - Path to configuration file
- `-H, --host string` - Override host address
- `-p, --port string` - Override port  
- `-d, --debug` - Enable debug logging
- `--production` - Enable production (JSON) logging

## Configuration

The configuration is done in form of a yaml file. _david_ will scan the
following locations for the presence of a `config.yaml` in the following
order:

- The directory `./config`
- The directory `$HOME/.swd` (swd was the initial project name of david)
- The directory `$HOME/.david`
- The current working directory `.`

Alternatively, the path to a configuration file can be specified on the
command-line:

```sh
david server --config /path/to/config.yaml
```

You can also override configuration settings directly from command-line flags:

```sh
david server --config config.yaml --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080 --debug
```

**Priority:** CLI flags override config file settings.

### First steps

Here an example of a very simple but functional configuration:

```yaml
address: "127.0.0.1"        # the bind address
port: "8000"                # the listening port
dir: "/home/myuser/webdav"  # the provided base dir
prefix: "/webdav"           # the url-prefix of the original url
users:
  user:                     # with password 'foo' and jailed access to '/home/myuser/webdav/user'
    password: "$2a$10$yITzSSNJZAdDZs8iVBQzkuZCzZ49PyjTiPIrmBUKUpB0pwX7eySvW"
    subdir: "/user"
    permissions: "r"        # read only
  admin:                    # with password 'foo' and access to '/home/myuser/webdav'
    password: "$2a$10$DaWhagZaxWnWAOXY0a55.eaYccgtMOL3lGlqI3spqIBGyM0MD.EN6"
    permissions: "crud"
```

With this configuration you'll grant access for two users and the WebDAV
server is available under `http://127.0.0.1:8000/webdav`.

### TLS

At first, use your favorite toolchain to obtain a SSL certificate and
keyfile (if you don't  already have some).

Here an example with `openssl`:

```sh
# Generate a keypair
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -days 365
# Remove the passphrase from the key file
openssl rsa -in key.pem -out clean_key.pem
```

Now you can reference your keypair in the configuration via:

```yaml
address: "127.0.0.1"    # the bind address
port: "8000"            # the listening port
dir: "/home/myuser/webdav"     # the provided base directory
tls:
  keyFile: clean_key.pem
  certFile: cert.pem
users:
  ...

```

The presence of the `tls` section is completely enough to let the server
start with a TLS secured HTTPS connection.

In the current release version you must take care, that the private key
doesn't need a passphrase. Otherwise starting the server will fail.

### Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)

In case you intend to operate this server from a web browser based application,
you might need to allow [CORS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing)
access. To achieve that, you can configure the host you want to grant access to:

```yaml
cors:
  origin: "*"        # the origin to allow, or '*' for all
  credentials: true  # whether to allow credentials via CORS
```

Note however that this has security implications, so be careful in production
environments.

### Behind a proxy

_david_ will also work behind a reverse proxy. Here is an example
configuration with `apache2 httpd`'s `mod_proxy`:

```xml
<Location /webdav>
  ProxyPass           https://webdav-host:8000/
  ProxyPassReverse    https://webdav-host:8000/
</Location>
```

Here is an example of david using a [json caddyfile](https://caddyserver.com/docs/json/) for a reverse proxy:
```json
{
    "admin": {
      "disabled": false,
      "listen": "0.0.0.0:2019",
      "enforce_origin": false,
      "origins": [
        "127.0.0.1"
      ],
      "config": {
        "persist": false
      }
    },
    "apps": {
      "http": {
        "servers": {
          "MyServers": {
            "listen": [
              ":443"
            ],
            "routes": [
              {
                "match": [
                  {
                    "host": [
                      "files.example.com"
                    ]
                  }
                ],
                "handle": [
                  {
                    "handler": "reverse_proxy",
                    "upstreams": [
                      {
                        "dial": ":8000"
                      }
                    ]
                  }
                ]
              }
            ]
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
```

### User management

User management in _david_ is very simple, but optional. You don't have to add users if it's not
necessary for your use case. But if you do, each user in the `config.yaml` **must** have a
password and **can** have a subdirectory.

The password must be in form of a BCrypt hash. You can generate one calling the shipped CLI
tool `bcpt passwd`:

```sh
bcpt passwd --password "your-password" --cost 10
```

Or interactively:

```sh
bcpt passwd
Enter password: ******
Hashed Password: $2a$10$...
```

**BCPT CLI Options:**
- `-p, --password string` - Password to hash (required)
- `-c, --cost int` - BCrypt cost factor (default 10)

If a subdirectory is configured for a user, the user is jailed within it and can't see anything
that exists outside of this directory. If no subdirectory is configured for an user, the user
can see and modify all files within the base directory.

### Logging

You can enable / disable logging for the following operations:

- **C**reation of files or directories
- **R**eading of files or directories
- **U**pdating of files or directories
- **D**eletion of files or directories

You can also enable or disable the error log.

All file-operation logs are disabled per default until you will turn it on via the following
config entries:

```yaml
log:
  production: false
  debug: true
  error: true
  create: true
  read: true
  update: true
  delete: true
...
```

**Log Formats:**

- **Text Mode** (`production: false`): Human-readable format with timestamps
- **JSON Mode** (`production: true`): Structured JSON format for log aggregation tools

**Control via CLI:**

Enable debug or production mode from command line:

```sh
david server --debug           # Enable debug logging
david server --production      # Enable JSON log format
```

**Priority:** CLI flags override config file settings.

**Log Examples:**

Attached TTY (text format):
```
INFO[0000] Server is starting and listening              address=0.0.0.0 port=8000 security=none
```

Detached TTY (timestamp format):
```
time="2018-04-14T20:46:00+02:00" level=info msg="Server is starting and listening" address=0.0.0.0 port=8000 security=none
```

Production mode (JSON format):
```json
{"level":"info","msg":"Server is starting and listening","address":"0.0.0.0","port":"8000","security":"none"}
```

### Live reload

There is no need to restart the server itself, if you're editing the user or log section of
the configuration. The config file will be re-read and the application will update it's own
configuration silently in background.

## Connecting

You could simply connect to the WebDAV server with an HTTP(S) connection and a tool that
allows the WebDAV protocol.

For example: Under OSX you can use the default file management tool *Finder*. Press _CMD+K_,
enter the server address (e.g. `http://localhost:8000`) and choose connect.

## Issues on Windows?
Windows 11 is not going to let you map the network drive with a self signed certificate or no running david with no certificate (at all). 
Consider using Caddy, or use Cyberduck - which will let you connect with a self signed certificate. There might be a way around this
by editing a windows register, but I don't recommend that. Just use Cyberduck, or try out Cybermount.
The easiest option is a reverse proxy running Caddy, in my honest opinion. Caddy v2 will sign the certificate, and you can run david
with no TLS needed since Caddy is handling the encryption over the internet.
